-------------------Build Gradle Project - which will run tests------------------------------------

    gradle clean build ( There are tests at the service level and controller level which 
    comprise the unit level tests. There are also some integration tests that will test the real apis

------------------ API RUN TIME ANALYSIS ----------------------------------------------------

        
            
            Let M = # OF Metrics Existing  
            Let N = # OF Metrics submitted 
            Let V[M] = # of DataPoints for each metric 
        
        **1.) Create a Metric -** 
        
            
            _Time Complexity will be O(N)_ because we are peforming N Puts on a HashMap which will take constant time
            given the equal distribution of keys . We are also performing N adds into an arraylist which will also be
            constant time. Unless There is a capacity increase but the amortized cost of adding is O(1). 
            
            _Space Complexity will be  O(N+M)_ because we need space for existing metrics as well as submitted metrics 
         
        
        **2.) Update a Metric -** 
        
            _Time Complexity will be O(N)_ as N  (HashMap put / get) constant time. 
            
            _Space Complexity will be O(N+M)_
            
        **3.) Get Summary Statistics -**
        
            _Time Complexity will be O( N * (MAX(V[M]) * log(MAX(V[M])  )_ - When we get the Summary Statistics we are peforming N lookups
            to retrieve the lists of each metric. We are then iterating through each list to aggregate the statistics 
            to perform some arithmetic constant time operations & peforming a sort ( best sort time is usually more than size of input
            
            time operations.  
            
            __The Space Complexity will be O(N+M)__
